  <h3>web developer</h3>
<img src="https://www.edlibre.com/wp-content/uploads/The-complete.jpg">
<p >A web developer is a programmer who specializes in, or is specifically engaged in, the development of World Wide Web applications using a client–server model. The applications typically use <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML">HTML</a> , CSS and JavaScript in the client, PHP, ASP.NET (C#), Python, Node.js, Go or Java in the server, and http for communications between client and server. A web content management system is often used to develop and maintain web applications.</p>

Objective C (for iOS) or Java (for Android)
Graphic design
User interface (UI) design
Experience working with REST web services (for integrating with cloud services)
The salary midpoint for mobile applications developers is $146,500.</p>

  <p  >An applications architect creates a plan for the technical implementation of a software project. As applications become more critical to businesses and more complex to build, demand for these professionals grows — and so does the programming salary. Midpoint compensation for applications architects is $141,750.</p>

  <p>There are countless definitions of what computer programming is, but the one I use is:
“Programming is how you get computers to solve problems.”
There are two key phrases here which are important:
you: without the programmer (you), the computer is useless. It does what you tell it to do.
solve problems: computers are tools. They are complex tools, admittedly, but they are not mysterious or magical: they exist to make tasks easier.
Computer programs (or software) are what make computers work. Without software, modern computers are just complicated machines for turning electricity into heat. It’s software on your computer that runs your operating system, browser, email, games, movie player – just about everything.
Programming is a creative task: there is no right or wrong way to solve a problem, in the same way that there is no right or wrong way to paint a picture. There are choices to be made, and one way may seem better than another, but that doesn’t mean the other is wrong! With the right skills and experience, a programmer can craft software to solve an unlimited number of problems – from telling you when your next train will arrive to playing your favourite music. The possibilities are constrained only by your imagination. That’s why I love programming</p>
